# 1. What is meant by IPC Mechanism?

```c
1. IPC (Inter-Process Communication) is a mechanism that allows processes to communicate with each other and share data.
2. It is mainly used when multiple processes need to coordinate their actions or exchange information in an operating system.
```
# 2. Why we use IPC Mechanism? 
```c
1. Multiple processes did not communicate with eachother directly. They use IPC Mechanism to communicate between multiple process.

```
# 3. What are the types of IPC Mechanism's?  

```c
1. Pipe's
2. Named pipes
3. Message Queue
4. Shared memory
5. Semaphores

```
# 4. What is meant by “unicast” and “multicast” IPC?  

```c
Unicast IPC

Definition:
Unicast IPC means communication between one sender and one receiver process only.

In simple words:

One process sends a message → Only one specific process receives it.


Multicast IPC

Definition:
Multicast IPC means communication between one sender and multiple receivers simultaneously.

In simple words:

One process sends a message → Multiple processes receive it at the same time.
```
# 5. What is meant by PIPES?  

```c
1. It is an IPC Mechanism tha can be only used in related process(i.e, Parent and child process)
2. Pipes can be accessed via basic i/o calls or universal i/o calls.
```
# 6. What is meant by Blocking Calls? 

```c
1. A blocking call is a type of function or system call that does not return control to the program until the requested operation is completed.
2. In simple words — the process waits (is blocked) until the operation finishes.
```
# 7. What are the types of Blocking Calls?
```c
These blocking calls can be categorized based on what type of operation causes the block.

1. Blocking I/O Calls

These are the most common type of blocking calls.
They block a process while performing Input/Output (I/O) operations such as reading or writing.

Examples:

read() → waits until data is available to read

write() → waits until the data is written completely

accept() → waits until a client connects (in socket programming)

recv() and send() → wait for data transfer in network sockets

2. Blocking Synchronization Calls

These occur when a process waits for synchronization with another process or thread.
Used to prevent race conditions or ensure proper order of execution.

Examples:

wait() → waits for a child process to finish

pthread_join() → waits for a thread to complete

sem_wait() → waits for a semaphore to be available

pthread_mutex_lock() → waits if the mutex is already locked

3. Blocking System Calls (General)

These include any kernel-level call that waits for an event or resource to become available.
They are not limited to I/O or synchronization.

Examples:

sleep() → process blocks for a certain time

pause() → blocks until a signal is received

select() or poll() → block until one of multiple file descriptors becomes ready

nanosleep() → suspends execution for a specific duration

4. Blocking Communication Calls (IPC)

In Inter-Process Communication, blocking occurs when a process waits for data from another process.

Examples:

Pipes: read() blocks until data is written to pipe

Message Queues: msgrcv() blocks until a message is available

Sockets: recv() blocks until data arrives

Shared Memory: Often used with semaphores → blocked until allowed access


| Type of Blocking Call            | Description                                 | Example Functions                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Blocking I/O**                 | Waits for input/output to complete          | `read()`, `write()`, `accept()`          |
| **Blocking Synchronization**     | Waits for another process/thread/resource   | `wait()`, `sem_wait()`, `pthread_join()` |
| **Blocking System Call**         | Waits for a time/event/resource             | `sleep()`, `pause()`, `select()`         |
| **Blocking Communication (IPC)** | Waits for data/message from another process | `msgrcv()`, `recv()`, `pipe read()`      |


```

# 8. What are the different types of I/O Calls? 

```c
In an operating system, I/O (Input/Output) calls refer to system calls or functions that perform data transfer between a process and an I/O device (like a file, network socket, or pipe).

There are 4 main types of I/O operations based on how the process interacts with the kernel and whether it waits for the operation to finish.

1. Blocking I/O

Definition:
In blocking I/O, the process waits (is blocked) until the I/O operation (read/write) is completely finished.

Working:

Process requests data (e.g., read()).

Process is put to sleep until the data is ready.

Once data is available, it’s copied to user space.

Process resumes execution.

Example Code:

char buf[100];
int n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf)); // blocks until data arrives


Diagram:

Process:  |---request--->| (waiting...) |<---data ready---|


 Advantage: Simple and easy to implement.
 Disadvantage: Process cannot do anything else while waiting.

2. Non-Blocking I/O

Definition:
In non-blocking I/O, the process does not wait if the data is not ready.
The system call returns immediately — either with data or an error (like EAGAIN).

Working:

Process calls I/O function.

If data is not ready, call returns immediately.

Process can do other work and try again later.

Example Code:

fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK); // Set file descriptor to non-blocking
int n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
if (n < 0)
    perror("No data available yet!");


 Advantage: CPU not wasted waiting.
 Disadvantage: Requires repeated polling (checking again and again).

3. I/O Multiplexing (a.k.a. Event-driven I/O)

Definition:
The process uses select(), poll(), or epoll() to wait for multiple I/O events simultaneously.
It only blocks when waiting for any one of several I/O sources to become ready.

Working:

Process registers multiple file descriptors.

Waits until at least one becomes ready.

Performs I/O only on ready descriptors.

Example Code:

fd_set readfds;
FD_ZERO(&readfds);
FD_SET(fd1, &readfds);
FD_SET(fd2, &readfds);

select(maxfd + 1, &readfds, NULL, NULL, NULL); // Blocks until one is ready


 Advantage: Efficient for handling multiple I/O sources (like servers).
 Disadvantage: Slightly more complex to code.

4. Asynchronous (AIO) I/O

Definition:
In asynchronous I/O, the process starts an I/O operation and continues executing without waiting.
When the I/O finishes, the kernel notifies the process (via signal or callback).

Working:

Process requests I/O.

Kernel performs I/O in background.

Process continues doing other work.

Kernel sends notification when done.

Example (Pseudo-code):

aio_read(&aiocb); 

 Advantage: Best performance; process never blocks.
Disadvantage: Most complex to implement and debug.

# 9. What are the I/O calls we are used in IPC Mechanisms? 


In Inter-Process Communication (IPC), processes exchange data using various kernel-level mechanisms like pipes, FIFOs, message queues, shared memory, semaphores, and sockets.

Each of these mechanisms internally relies on I/O system calls provided by the operating system.

# 11. What is meant by Named Pipes? 

### Definition:
A Named Pipe, also called a FIFO (First In, First Out), is an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism that allows two or more unrelated processes to communicate with each other by reading and writing through a special file in the filesystem.


Key points

| Feature               | Description                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Type**              | IPC mechanism                                                            |
| **Full Form**         | FIFO – First In, First Out                                               |
| **Communication**     | Unidirectional (one process writes, another reads)                       |
| **Between Processes** | Works for **unrelated** processes (unlike normal pipes)                  |
| **Data Flow**         | The data written first is read first (FIFO order)                        |
| **Exists as a File**  | Appears as a **special file** in the filesystem (created using `mkfifo`) |


# 12. Where is the FIFO Object created?  

```c
A FIFO (Named Pipe) object is created in the file system (directory structure) as a special file.

When you create a named pipe using the system call:

mkfifo("myfifo", 0666);


 A special file named “myfifo” is created in the current working directory (or the specified path).
This file is not a regular file — it’s a special FIFO file recognized by the kernel.

 Where exactly it exists

It exists in the file system namespace, like /home/user/myfifo or /tmp/myfifo.

It is managed by the kernel but represented as a file so that processes can open it using standard I/O calls (open(), read(), write()).
```
# 13. What is the call used to create a FIFO Object?  
```c
mkfifo("myfifo", 0666);
```
# 14. What are the Blocking Calls used in Named Pipes? 
```c
In Named Pipes (FIFOs), the main blocking system calls are:

1. open()

2. read()

3. write()
```
# 15. Why read system calls acts as a blocking call? 

```c
1. read() blocks because it waits for data to become available before returning to the process.
2. If no data is present, the process cannot proceed, so it is suspended (blocked) by the kernel until data arrives.

When a process calls:

int n = read(fd, buffer, size);


The kernel checks if there’s data available in the file descriptor fd.

If data is available → read() copies it to the buffer → returns immediately.

If no data is available → read() blocks the process and puts it in the sleep state until another process writes data.
```
# 16. Difference between the Named Pipes and Pipes?  

| Feature                 | Pipe (Anonymous Pipe)                                                                | Named Pipe (FIFO)                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**          | A unidirectional communication channel between **related processes** (parent-child). | A special file in the filesystem used for communication between **unrelated processes**. |
| **Name in File System** | No name in file system (anonymous).                                                  | Has a **name in the filesystem** (created using `mkfifo()`).                             |
| **Communication**       | One-way (can be made two-way using two pipes).                                       | Usually one-way, but can be two-way using two FIFOs.                                     |
| **Process Relation**    | Works only between **related processes**.                                            | Works between **unrelated processes**.                                                   |
| **Lifetime**            | Exists **only while processes are running**.                                         | Exists **even if no process is using it**; persists in the filesystem until deleted.     |
| **Creation**            | `pipe(int fd[2])` system call.                                                       | `mkfifo("filename", 0666)` system call.                                                  |
| **Blocking Behavior**   | `read()` and `write()` are blocking if no data / buffer full.                        | Same — `open()`, `read()`, and `write()` can block.                                      |
| **Use Case**            | Parent-child communication.                                                          | Communication between unrelated processes or long-lived communication channels.          |

# 17. What is return value of read system call? 

| Return Value | Meaning                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **> 0**      | Number of **bytes actually read** and copied into the buffer. Can be **less than the requested size**. |
| **0**        | **End-of-File (EOF)** reached — no more data to read.                                                  |
| **-1**       | **Error occurred** — check `errno` for details.                                                        |


# 18. What is meant by message queue?
```c
A message queue is a communication mechanism used in Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to allow processes to send and receive messages in an organized and asynchronous manner.

. Separate system calls are used for accessint message queues as compared to pipes and named pipes


1. It acts as a buffer (queue) maintained by the kernel.

2. The queue stores messages sent by one process until another process retrieves them.

3. Each message queue is identified by a unique key (identifier).

4. Communication can happen between any two or more unrelated processes.
```
# 19. Why we use message queues?

### Definition:

A message queue is a method of interprocess communication (IPC) that allows processes to exchange data in the form of messages.
It provides a queue (FIFO) structure maintained by the operating system kernel, where messages can be stored temporarily until the receiving process reads them.

### Purpose:

The main purpose of message queues is to enable asynchronous communication between processes.
That means the sender and receiver processes do not need to run at the same time — one process can send a message and continue its execution, while another process can receive it later.

### Features of Message Queues:

   - Communication takes place through the kernel (not by direct memory sharing).

   - Messages are stored in a queue and can be retrieved in the order they are sent (FIFO).
 
   - Each message has a type, which allows selective receiving.

   - Processes are decoupled, i.e., they do not need to know each other’s identity.

   - Message queues provide synchronization between processes.

   - Communication is asynchronous — the sender doesn’t have to wait for the receiver.
     
# 20. What is difference between Named Pipe and Message Queue?
| **Feature**                   | **Named Pipe (FIFO)**                                                                                           | **Message Queue**                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**                | A special file that allows unidirectional or bidirectional data flow between processes in a byte stream format. | A kernel-managed queue that allows processes to exchange structured messages.                                |
| **Communication Type**        | Byte-oriented (stream-based).                                                                                   | Message-oriented (each message has a type and data).                                                         |
| **Identification**            | Identified by a name in the file system (created using `mkfifo()` or `mknod()`).                                | Identified by a key (System V) or name (POSIX) created using `ftok()` or specified in `mq_open()`.           |
| **Data Storage**              | Data flows continuously without message boundaries.                                                             | Messages are stored separately in the queue with boundaries.                                                 |
| **Synchronization**           | Sender and receiver must coordinate; synchronous communication.                                                 | Asynchronous communication; sender and receiver work independently.                                          |
| **Selective Receiving**       | Not possible — data is read in order.                                                                           | Possible — receiver can choose messages by type.                                                             |
| **Persistence**               | Data is removed once read.                                                                                      | Messages remain in queue until explicitly received or queue is deleted.                                      |
| **Communication Scope**       | Can be used between related or unrelated processes if accessible.                                               | Can be used between any processes having access to the queue key or name.                                    |
| **Full Duplex Communication** | Requires two FIFOs for two-way communication.                                                                   | A single queue can support two-way communication using message types.                                        |
| **Speed**                     | Faster (simple byte stream).                                                                                    | Slower (kernel-managed and structured).                                                                      |
| **Complexity**                | Simple to implement.                                                                                            | More complex due to structured format and system calls.                                                      |
| **System Calls**              | `mkfifo()`, `write()`, `read()`, `unlink()`.                                                                    | `msgget()`, `msgsnd()`, `msgrcv()`, `msgctl()` (or `mq_open()`, `mq_send()`, `mq_receive()`, `mq_unlink()`). |
| **Use Cases**                 | Simple data streaming, producer-consumer models.                                                                | Asynchronous client-server communication, logging, and real-time systems.                                    |


# 21. What is the system call used to create the message queue?
### System call is  -  int msgget(key_t key, int msgflg);
| **Parameter** | **Description**                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `key`         | A unique key value (usually generated using the `ftok()` function) used to identify the message queue.                |
| `msgflg`      | Flags that control permissions and creation options (e.g., `IPC_CREAT`, `IPC_EXCL`, and permission bits like `0666`). |


# 22. Where was the message queue created?

The message queue is created and maintained by the operating system kernel — not in the user’s memory or file system.

📍 Detailed Explanation:

When a process calls the system call:
### msgget(key, msgflg);

the kernel checks whether a message queue with the specified key already exists.

If it doesn’t exist and the flag IPC_CREAT is given,
the kernel creates a new message queue in its internal IPC (Inter-Process Communication) table.

### **23. What is meant by Shared Memory?**
Shared Memory is an **Interprocess Communication (IPC)** mechanism that allows **two or more processes to access the same portion of memory**. 
This memory segment is created by one process and can be attached to other processes, allowing them to **read and write data directly** to the same memory area. 
It provides the **fastest method of data exchange** between processes because data does not need to be copied through the kernel.

---

### **24. Why we use Shared Memory?**
We use **Shared Memory** to achieve **high-speed communication** between processes. 
It avoids the overhead of message passing since all processes can directly access the same memory region. 
It is mostly used in **real-time and performance-critical applications**.

**Advantages:**
- Very fast communication (no kernel data copying).
- Suitable for large data transfers.
- Useful for data sharing between related or unrelated processes.

---

### **25. Difference between Shared Memory and Message Queues**

| **Feature** | **Shared Memory** | **Message Queue** |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Definition** | Allows multiple processes to access a common memory segment. | Allows processes to communicate using structured messages stored in a queue. |
| **Communication Type** | Memory-based (direct access). | Message-based (kernel managed). |
| **Speed** | Very fast (direct access). | Slower (involves kernel intervention). |
| **Synchronization** | Requires additional mechanisms (like semaphores) to avoid conflicts. | Synchronization handled internally by the kernel. |
| **Data Transfer** | Suitable for large data. | Suitable for small data or control messages. |
| **Persistence** | Exists until removed using `shmctl()`. | Exists until deleted using `msgctl()`. |
| **System Calls** | `shmget()`, `shmat()`, `shmdt()`, `shmctl()`. | `msgget()`, `msgsnd()`, `msgrcv()`, `msgctl()`. |

---

### **26. What is the use of stat command?**
The **`stat`** command in Linux is used to **display detailed information about a file or directory**, such as:  
- File type and permissions  
- Inode number  
- Ownership (user and group)  
- Size in bytes  
- Last access, modification, and change times  

**Example:**
```bash
stat filename.txt
```
**Output shows:** File size, permissions, user ID, group ID, access times, etc.

---

### **27. What is the use of semctl command?**
The **`semctl`** system call is used to **control and manage semaphore sets** in System V IPC.  
It can perform various operations such as:
- **Get or set semaphore values**
- **Retrieve semaphore information**
- **Remove semaphore set**

**Syntax:**
```c
int semctl(int semid, int semnum, int cmd, ...);
```
**Common Commands:**
- `IPC_RMID` → Remove semaphore set  
- `GETVAL` → Get current value of a semaphore  
- `SETVAL` → Set value of a semaphore  

---

### **28. How do we destroy the shared memory object?**
A shared memory segment is destroyed using the **`shmctl()`** system call with the **`IPC_RMID`** command.

**Syntax:**
```c
shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, NULL);
```
This call removes the shared memory segment identified by `shmid` from the system.

---

### **29. What is meant by Semaphores?**
A **Semaphore** is a synchronization mechanism used to **control access to a shared resource** by multiple processes.  
It is an integer variable that is modified using two atomic operations:
- **Wait (P or down)** → Decreases semaphore value. If value < 0, the process waits.  
- **Signal (V or up)** → Increases semaphore value. If processes are waiting, one is allowed to proceed.

**Types of Semaphores:**
1. **Binary Semaphore:** Takes values 0 or 1 (used for mutual exclusion).  
2. **Counting Semaphore:** Can take any non-negative integer value (used for resource counting).

**Usage:** Prevents race conditions, ensures mutual exclusion, and synchronizes process execution.

---

### **30. Why we use Semaphores?**
Semaphores are used to **control access to shared resources** and to **synchronize multiple processes or threads**.  
They prevent race conditions and ensure that only one process accesses a critical section at a time.

**Uses:**
- Ensuring **mutual exclusion**.
- **Synchronizing** producer–consumer or reader–writer processes.
- Controlling **resource allocation** among multiple processes.

---

### **31. What is meant by Synchronization?**
**Synchronization** is the process of **coordinating the execution of multiple processes or threads** so that they operate in a controlled manner without conflicts.  
It ensures that **shared resources are accessed by only one process at a time**, preventing inconsistencies and race conditions.

**Example:**  
If two processes try to update the same variable simultaneously, synchronization ensures that one completes before the other starts.

---

### **32. What is meant by Asynchronization?**
**Asynchronization** means that processes or threads **execute independently without waiting for each other**.  
In asynchronous execution, one process does not need to finish before another begins — they can work concurrently.

**Example:**  
In message queues, the sender can send a message and continue execution without waiting for the receiver.

---

### **33. Why we use Mutex Locks?**
A **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion) Lock** is used to **protect critical sections** of code so that only **one thread or process** can execute them at a time.  
It helps prevent **race conditions** and ensures **data consistency**.

**Usage:**
- Lock the critical section before accessing shared data.
- Unlock after completing the operation.

---

### **34. What is the difference between Mutex Locks and Semaphores?**

| **Feature** | **Mutex Lock** | **Semaphore** |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Definition** | A locking mechanism that allows only one thread to access a resource at a time. | A signaling mechanism that controls access to resources using counters. |
| **Type** | Binary (0 or 1). | Binary or Counting. |
| **Ownership** | Only the thread that locked it can unlock it. | Can be signaled by any process. |
| **Usage** | Used for mutual exclusion. | Used for synchronization and resource counting. |
| **Implementation** | Simpler and lighter. | More complex (managed by kernel). |
| **Blocking Behavior** | Thread blocks if mutex is already locked. | Process may wait if semaphore count is zero. |

---

### **35. What is meant by Race Condition?**
A **Race Condition** occurs when **two or more processes access shared data simultaneously**, and the **final result depends on the order of execution**.  
It leads to **inconsistent or incorrect results**.

**Example:**  
If two processes increment the same variable at the same time without synchronization, the final value may be wrong.

---

### **36. What is meant by Deadlock?**
A **Deadlock** is a situation in which **two or more processes are waiting for resources held by each other**, causing all of them to **wait forever**.

**Necessary Conditions for Deadlock:**
1. **Mutual Exclusion** – Only one process can use a resource at a time.  
2. **Hold and Wait** – A process is holding one resource and waiting for another.  
3. **No Preemption** – A resource cannot be forcibly taken away.  
4. **Circular Wait** – A cycle of processes each waiting for the next.

---

### **37. What is meant by Critical Section?**
A **Critical Section** is a part of a program where **shared resources (like variables or files)** are accessed.  
Only one process or thread should execute in the critical section at a time to **prevent race conditions**.

**Example:**  
Updating a shared counter variable inside two processes must be done in a critical section protected by a semaphore or mutex.

---

### **38. What is the difference between System V and POSIX?**

| **Feature** | **System V IPC** | **POSIX IPC** |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Introduction** | Older System V standard (AT&T UNIX). | Newer IEEE POSIX standard. |
| **API Type** | System calls (`msgget`, `shmget`, `semget`). | Library functions (`mq_open`, `shm_open`, `sem_open`). |
| **Identification** | Uses keys generated by `ftok()`. | Uses string names (e.g., "/myqueue"). |
| **Communication** | Works between processes only. | Can work between processes and threads. |
| **Ease of Use** | More complex and low-level. | Simpler and more user-friendly. |
| **Resource Removal** | Removed using `msgctl`, `shmctl`, `semctl`. | Removed using `mq_unlink`, `shm_unlink`, `sem_unlink`. |
| **Standardization** | Proprietary to UNIX systems. | Portable across UNIX-like systems. |

---

### **39. Steps to Create and Use a Named Pipe (FIFO) for IPC**

1. **Create the FIFO** using `mkfifo()` or the shell command `mknod`.
   ```c
   mkfifo("fifo1", 0666);
   ```
2. **Open the FIFO** for reading or writing using `open()`.  
3. **Write data** to the FIFO using `write()`.  
4. **Read data** from the FIFO using `read()`.  
5. **Close the FIFO** using `close()`.  
6. **Remove FIFO** (optional) using `unlink()` when no longer needed.

**Example:**
```c
mkfifo("fifo1", 0666);
int fd = open("fifo1", O_WRONLY);
write(fd, "Hello", 6);
close(fd);
```

---

### **40. Steps to Create and Use a Pipe for IPC**

1. **Create the pipe** using the `pipe()` system call.
   ```c
   int fd[2];
   pipe(fd);
   ```
   - `fd[0]` → read end  
   - `fd[1]` → write end  

2. **Fork the process** using `fork()`.  
   - Parent writes data using `write(fd[1], ...)`  
   - Child reads data using `read(fd[0], ...)`  

3. **Close unused ends** after communication.  
4. **Terminate processes** when communication completes.

**Example:**
```c
int fd[2];
pipe(fd);
if (fork() == 0) {
    close(fd[1]);
    char msg[50];
    read(fd[0], msg, sizeof(msg));
    printf("Child received: %s", msg);
} else {
    close(fd[0]);
    write(fd[1], "Hello Child", 12);
}
```
